# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing courtesy and professionalism

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Harassment, public or private
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Sexualized language or imagery; sexual attention or advances
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening a minimal issue titled “Code of Conduct: request private contact” without details. A community leader will follow up privately. Reports are reviewed within 3 business days, and the team will maintain confidentiality as much as possible.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines to determine the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. Correction

- Consequence: A private, written warning; education on why the behavior was inappropriate; a request for an apology.

2. Warning

- Impact: A single incident or a series of actions.
- Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior; no interaction with the people involved for a specified period; required compliance with rules.

3. Temporary Ban

- Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.
- Consequence: A temporary ban from interaction or participation for a specified period.

4. Permanent Ban
